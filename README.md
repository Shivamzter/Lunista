### Features as of now:

1. LabPBR normal mapping (can be toggled in shader settings)
2. LabPBR texture AO (can be toggled in shader settings)
3. Built-in tonemap (not configurable, it just exists)
4. Basic (shadow resolution can be changed in shader settings)
- shadow mapping improved from Iris tutorial thanks to eldeston
5. Some fog

### Future plans:

1. Sky/Sunlgiht, Moonlight, fog improvements (should improve the overall feel of the shader)
2. Emissives
3. Specular mapping
4. tonemap improvement
5. You tell me (no big things for now tho as I'm still learning, so nothing RT related)

God rays (tried, but they don't look good, have to do volumetric godrays instead so that'll be in far future)
