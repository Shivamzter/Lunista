### Features as of now:

1. LabPBR normal mapping (can be toggled in shader settings)
2. LabPBR texture AO (can be toggled in shader settings)
3. LabPBR F0/HCM support
4. LabPBR emissives (can be toggled in shader settings)
5. Built-in tonemap (not configurable, it just exists)
6. Basic shadow mapping (shadow resolution can be changed in shader settings)
7. Some fog
8. BLOOM

### Future plans:

1. Sky/Sunlgiht, Moonlight, fog improvements (should improve the overall feel of the shader)
2. Improve Bloom/Emissive handling
3. SSR
4. Change Water
5. tonemap improvement
6. You tell me (no big things for now tho as I'm still learning, so nothing RT related)

God rays (tried, but they don't look good, have to do volumetric godrays instead so that'll be in far future)
Specular mapping (better to do on Cook tollerance BRDF)
